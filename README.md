# Dynamical

Project implemented as part of the Mobile Programming course in the academic year 2021/22. The goal of this project was to create a simple app used for tracking hiking and cycling tours.

## Additional notes

To setup application add the following line to local.properties file. This is needed for maps to run properly:
```

```
